# Doodle Jump Reinforcement Learning Agents

## Overview

This project implements and compares various reinforcement learning (RL) agents to play the classic **Doodle Jump** game. Leveraging both pixel-based and feature-based approaches, the project utilizes the following algorithms:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
- **Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)**

By employing these algorithms on both pixel data and engineered features, the project aims to analyze and compare their performance across different metrics.
